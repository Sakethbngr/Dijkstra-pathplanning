Instructions to run the file:

Open run the python file
The code prompts you to input the x and y co-ordinates of start and goal nodes. Input the necesasry co-ordinates.
In worst case scenario, it takes a maximum of 20 mins for the code to run and generate the path. You can go grab a coffee or snack in mean time, while my code takes an eternity to run :D (I did the same while testing it :D)
The reason for delay might be because the 'find_min_nodes' function I wrote takes too much time to compute (I used Cprofile to check the reason). The other reason might be my clumsy wiring of the dijkstra algorithm.
